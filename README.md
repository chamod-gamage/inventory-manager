# Chamod's Inventory Manager

Inspired by the Shopify Backend Developer Challenge, I created a web application for you to manage items in your inventory and assign them to warehouses. 
This project was primarily focused on backend development, so the frontend user interface is quite minimal.

Go check it out on its Replit deployment at https://inventory-manager.chamodgamage.repl.co/.

The Replit project is viewable here: https://replit.com/@ChamodGamage/inventory-manager#README.md

Note that the deployment link works in its own tab.

Here's a brief instructional video on how to use the application:
